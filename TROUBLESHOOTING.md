# Sabeel Project Troubleshooting Guide

## Node.js Environment Issues

After extensive testing, we've identified critical issues with the Node.js environment that are preventing the Sabeel project from running properly.

### Identified Problems

1. **Node.js Environment Error**: All attempts to run Node.js scripts result in the same error:
   ```
   Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'dimensions')
   ```

2. **Core Node.js Commands Failing**: Even basic Node.js commands like `node --version` and `npm --version` are failing with the same error, indicating a fundamental problem with the Node.js installation or environment.

### Recommended Solutions

#### 1. Reinstall Node.js

1. Uninstall the current Node.js installation:
   - On Windows: Use the Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program
   - Or use the Node.js uninstaller if available

2. Download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js from the official website:
   - Visit [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts

3. Verify the installation:
   - Open a new command prompt/terminal
   - Run `node --version` and `npm --version`

#### 2. Check for Environment Conflicts

1. Check for conflicting Node.js installations:
   - Look for multiple Node.js installations in Program Files
   - Check PATH environment variables for conflicting entries

2. Check for global npm packages that might be causing conflicts:
   - After reinstalling Node.js, run `npm list -g --depth=0`

#### 3. Project-Specific Setup

After fixing the Node.js environment:

1. Install project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start with the simplified application:
   ```
   node simplified-app.js
   ```

3. If the simplified app works, gradually reintroduce components from the main application.

### Alternative Approach: Use Docker

If reinstalling Node.js doesn't resolve the issue, consider using Docker to isolate the development environment:

1. Install Docker Desktop from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

2. Create a Dockerfile in the project root:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:18
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm install
   COPY . .
   EXPOSE 8080
   CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker container:
   ```
   docker build -t sabeel-app .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 sabeel-app
   ```

## Project Structure Recommendations

Based on the analysis of the project files, here are some recommendations for improving the project structure:

1. **Separate Frontend and Backend**: Clearly separate the React frontend from any Node.js backend services.

2. **Simplify Dependencies**: Review the extensive list of dependencies in package.json and remove any that aren't necessary.

3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with a minimal working version and add features incrementally, testing at each step.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application to catch and log specific errors.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the Node.js environment using the steps above
2. Test with the simplified application files created during troubleshooting
3. Gradually reintroduce components from the main application
4. Implement proper error handling throughout the application

By following this approach, you should be able to identify and resolve the specific issues preventing the Sabeel project from running properly.
