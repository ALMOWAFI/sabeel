<!-- This is a binary file. I'll create a placeholder with instructions on how to create it -->

To create this file:
1. Create a 200x200px transparent PNG with a subtle Islamic geometric pattern
2. Use gold (#D4AF37) color with 10-20% opacity
3. Create repeating geometric shapes typical of Islamic art (stars, hexagons or interlaced patterns)
4. Save as PNG with transparency

For the purposes of this implementation, we'll use the file that will be uploaded to the correct location.
